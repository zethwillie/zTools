Some tools to speed up my work. You're welcome to use as you see fit, presented as is, no promises:)

To use: Drop the entire zTools folder into your scripts folder (or somewhere in your maya python path). In maya, in python shell or cmd line type (no quotes): "import zTools.zbw_tools; zbw_tools.tools()".

I'm including some scripts in these folders that are not mine. I take no credit for their awesomeness, just like to have them handy for my own use.
cometJointOrient.mel
cometRename.mel
tweenMachine.py
mayaDecorators.py

I also have scripts that I don't install/unpack automatically but include so I can do so if I need them:
studioLibrary
animBot (deprecated)

There are lots little things in here that I'm not using currently, either WIP or scraps of stuff. Feel free to ignore those.
