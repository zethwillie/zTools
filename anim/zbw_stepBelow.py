#TO-DO----------------make zbw_anim as a base of code

#TO-DO---------------------make UI
#TO-DO---------------------using UI, give option for what type of tangents (so not just step) and time ranges(timeline or selected)
#TO-DO---------------------make sure it uses multiple selections (multiple objects selected)
#could just be option to select below? ? ? part of a bigger tool that does anim and blocking stuff. . .
